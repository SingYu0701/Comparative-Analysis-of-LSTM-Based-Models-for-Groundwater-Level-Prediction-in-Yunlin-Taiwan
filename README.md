# Comparative-Analysis-of-LSTM-Based-Models-for-Groundwater-Level-Prediction-in-Yunlin-Taiwan
Final report of Stochastic Subsurface Hydrology, 2025 @ NCKU Resource Engineering

-Conducted a comparative study on the applicability of LSTM, BiLSTM, CNN-LSTM, and CNN-BiLSTM models with varying temporal resolutions for groundwater level prediction in Taiwan.  
-Utilized observation data from groundwater monitoring wells and implemented the models using Python.
